# Data Analysis and Prediction of Data Breaches

## Introduction

This project involves conducting an analysis of a dataset of data breaches and building a machine learning model to predict the type of data breaches. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the patterns and trends in data breaches, and to understand the factors that influence the type of breach that occurs.

## Data

The data used in this project is a dataset of data breaches, which includes information about the type of breach, the location of the breached information, the number of individuals affected, and more.

## Methodology

The project involves several steps:

- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Predictive Modeling

## Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights about data breaches:

- The number of reported data breaches has generally been increasing over time.
- The most common types of data breaches are 'Hacking/IT Incident', 'Unauthorized Access/Disclosure', and 'Theft'.
- The most common locations of breached information are 'Network Server', 'Email', and 'Paper/Films'.
- The majority of breaches affect fewer than 2,500 individuals.
- The location of the breached information is a key factor in determining the type of data breach.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the patterns and trends in data breaches, as well as the factors that influence the type of breach that occurs. The findings could be useful for understanding and mitigating cybersecurity threats.
