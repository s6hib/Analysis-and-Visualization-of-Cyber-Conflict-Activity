# Data Analysis and Prediction of Data Breaches

In this project, we conducted an analysis of a dataset of data breaches and built a machine learning model to predict the type of data breaches. The goal of the project was to gain insights into the patterns and trends in data breaches, and to understand the factors that influence the type of breach that occurs.

## Importing Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import Counter
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

## Loading the Data

```python
# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data_breaches_all_clean.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
data.head()
```

## Data Cleaning

```python
# Convert 'Breach Submission Date' to datetime
data['Breach Submission Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Breach Submission Date'])

# Extract the year from 'Breach Submission Date'
data['Year'] = data['Breach Submission Date'].dt.year

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
data.head()
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```python
# Count the number of breaches each year
breaches_per_year = data['Year'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Display the number of breaches each year
breaches_per_year
```

```python
# Create a line plot of the number of breaches over time
plt.plot(breaches_per_year.index, breaches_per_year.values, marker='o')
plt.title('Number of Data Breaches Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Breaches')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

```python
# Count the number of each type of breach
breach_types = data['Type of Breach'].value_counts()

# Display the number of each type of breach
breach_types
```

```python
# Create a bar chart of the most common types of breaches
breach_types.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Most Common Types of Data Breaches')
plt.xlabel('Type of Breach')
plt.ylabel('Number of Breaches')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

```python
# Count the number of breaches associated with each location
breach_locations = data['Location of Breached Information'].value_counts()

# Display the number of breaches associated with each location
breach_locations
```

```python
# Create a bar chart of the locations with the most breached information
breach_locations.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Locations with the Most Breached Information')
plt.xlabel('Location of Breached Information')
plt.ylabel('Number of Breaches')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

```python
# Summary statistics of the 'Individuals Affected' column
data['Individuals Affected'].describe()
```

```python
# Create a histogram of the 'Individuals Affected' column
plt.hist(data['Individuals Affected'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of the Number of Individuals Affected by Data Breaches')
plt.xlabel('Number of Individuals Affected')
plt.ylabel('Number of Breaches')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Predictive Modeling

```python
# Select the features and the target variable
features = ['Year', 'Covered Entity Type', 'Location of Breached Information']
target = 'Type of Breach'

# Encode the categorical variables
label_encoders = {}
for column in features:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    data[column] = le.fit_transform(data[column])
    label_encoders[column] = le

# Split the data into a training set and a test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[features], data[target], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Random Forest classifier and fit it to the training data
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the classes of the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Compute the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
accuracy
```

## Feature Importances

```python
# Get the feature importances of the model
feature_importances = pd.Series(clf.feature_importances_, index=features)

# Display the feature importances
feature_importances.sort_values(ascending=False)
```

# Conclusion

In conclusion, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset of data breaches and built a predictive model that can predict the type of a data breach based on several features. These findings could provide valuable insights for understanding and mitigating cybersecurity threats.
